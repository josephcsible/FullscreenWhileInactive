# FullscreenWhileInactive

## Basics

### What does this mod do?
It lets Minecraft stay in fullscreen mode when it becomes inactive (i.e., when
you switch to another window). This was added to vanilla Minecraft 1.8 to fix
bug MC-55045, which made it very difficult for some users to enter fullscreen
at all.

### How do I use this mod?
You need Minecraft Forge installed first. Once that's done, just drop
fullscreenwhileinactive-*version*.jar in your Minecraft instance's mods/
directory.

## Development

### How do I compile this mod from source?
You need a JDK installed first. Start a command prompt or terminal in the
directory you downloaded the source to. If you're on Windows, type
`gradlew.bat build`. Otherwise, type `./gradlew build`. Once it's done, the mod
will be saved to build/libs/fullscreenwhileinactive-*version*.jar.

### When I try to run this mod from my IDE, it doesn't load!
Copy the dummy.jar file into the IDE instance's mods/ directory.

### How can I contribute to this mod's development?
Send pull requests. Note that by doing so, you agree to release your
contributions under this mod's license.

## Licensing/Permissions

### What license is this released under?
It's released under the GPL v2 or later.

### Can I use this in my modpack?
Yes, even if you monetize it with adf.ly or something, and you don't need to
ask me for my permission first.
